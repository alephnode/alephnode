\*\* Mention Plato thinking of "perfect forms" and how it can correlate to the way we design data schemas: free from the problems of

- there are ruling ideas about how best to design schema. List each one

- Overall analogy?

  - sample table/database set that needs to be broken into multiple tables. Easy split is behavior/action and agents of that action

- articles and books recommended for the subject
- database modeling and design

- more ideas about "normal form" are being added, but most agree on at least the first three as being scripture.
