# Background

- reducing toil and Google SRE pitch, why I wanted to automate the boilerplate away while also learning Rust.

Seemed like a good use case for the task. Figured after building I'd know:

- working with different data types 
- handling IO operations
- writing to a file
- designing project structure through a few different modules (io handler, template builder, main program)
- writing tests
- wiring it to the cli

# Why Rust - brief blurb

Talk about reasons why I learned
- coworkers cited as an example for a better language to write in that JS
- related, the polls showing it as the most developer happiness
- also kinda related; discuss safety and efficiency, how it interests you since deal with high-traffic workloads and would like to introduce at work in some way 
- web assembly

Before we get started: Yes, I know this could be a two-line bash script. (I know this because I wrote one to get that number.) Still, I'd rather learn Rust üòèü¶Ä, so stick around for the joy of exploration.

Alright, let's dive in.

# Scaffolding the Project

If you haven't already done so, install the rust compiler and package manager by following the instructions in the Rustlang documentation. <TODO link>

The project consist of only a few modules. Here's the tree structure for the repo: 

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.lock
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reader.rs
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ template.rs
```

Most of these files were generated from the `cargo new <project>` command. Give it a shot on your local machine to see an example scaffolded project for yourself.

Let's take a look at `main.rs` for a general overview of the program's workflow.

_main.rs_:

```rust
mod reader;
mod template;

fn main() {
    let template_info = reader::handle_input();
    template::generate(&template_info);
}
```

First, we bring two modules into scope: reader and template. We'll dig into those files in a moment.

For now, it's worth mentioning that our main function (the entrance into our application) contains only two lines of code. First, we store the result of a `handle_input` function from the reader module in a template (judging from the variable name). Next, we generate a template, passing the template info to the necessary builder. So far so predictable, if you ask me. 


# I/O, string handling, promises 

# Writing Files, more promises 

# Writing Tests, Promises/Types 

# Final Step: Creating a CLI Command

_Note: the following section assumes you're running on a Mac. TODO write the instructions for Windows maybe_

Finally, we're going to write a bash script and drop it in the proper path to make it executable.

Start by `cd`ing into the `/usr/local/bin` directory and creating a file. Name it something intuitive like `create-blog-page` (with no extension, as it'll eventually be the command you run).

The file contents should look like this:

_/usr/local/bin/create-blog-page:_

```
#!/bin/bash
cd ~/<path-to-rust-project>
cargo run
```

When you're finished, give the file the proper permissions to execute: `chmod 755 create-blog-page`

If everything's properly hooked up, you should be able to run the command and see the program kick off!

# What Lies Ahead

Look out for an article on merging Rust work with Web Assembly to deliver something fun over the web. Until then, here are a few resources I found helpful throughout my spike:
