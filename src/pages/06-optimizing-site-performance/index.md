In the <a href="/05-treading-critical-rendering" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I walked through the details of the critical rendering path. It explained the process an HTML file goes through from being received by the browser all the way to its visualization on the page.

For the second half of this topic, I'll focus on ways developers can reduce the time and cost associated with these steps, making for a more performant, enjoyable user experience as a result.

To better illustrate the ideas expressed, I'll walk through creating a simple SPA in vanilla JavaScript.

You can see the demo app here, or view/clone the source on GitHub and skip the next section if you're here only for the ðŸ”¥ perf tips.

### Building the Site

Before we can optimize the performance of a site, we need a site (!). Luckily, I've prepared a basic project for us to work with.

To get started, create a new simple project by running:

```bash
  yarn init
```

Enter through the details and you're good to go.

Now would be a good time to create the basic files

### Code Splitting

### Tree Shaking

### Service Worker

### Manifest.json, a11y
