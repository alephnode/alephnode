OK, we'll do it this way. Intro will present itself once other parts are more fleshed out, personal touches are considered. For now, let's create an outline.

- Importance of testing, emphasis on code you inherit. Make comparison of reason, too. Constantly be challenging assumptions while allowing them to establish a foundation for critical thought.

- Stack of choice. Test and CICD, importance of both 
- also explain example project, TDD approach taken 
- walk through project !
- pick a domain/deployment TARGET
- hook it up to jenkins
- find a way to wrap it up in a cool way 
- conclusion, referral to books
