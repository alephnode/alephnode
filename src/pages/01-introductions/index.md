Hi, I'm Ward ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack engineer with a background in journalism. I started this blog to share how I approach problems and arrive at solutions.

The topics will lean toward math and JavaScript, where my interests gravitate (aside from music).

Thus, the title: <b>aleph node</b>. For the unfamiliar, it's low-level wordplay marrying aleph null--an infinite number who's existence introduced me to <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Beginnings_of_set_theory.html" target="_blank">the magic of set theory</a>--and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/" target="_blank">Node</a>, the leading JavaScript runtime.

Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/alephnode" target="_blank">lurk my past work</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alephnode">follow my latest hot takes</a>.
