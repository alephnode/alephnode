### Ultimately question need to ask self: how can you say something novel about this topic? If not presenting new idea, supplement the material in a beneficial way

= in short: article's delta is emphasis on setting up local dev with docker-compose, ease of use to deploy when finished with Docker. Can also use Kubernetes (bonus)

### Intro

- quick update on personal life, flow 
- mention reason for checking Docker out

### Incentives

- explain cost and resource efficiency
- allows developers more control of their infrastructure 
- introduce dev/prod parity

I ran a test server alongside my dev server using docker-compose. The test server ran in watch mode, a workflow I've enjoyed as of late. 

### Repo/Walkthrough 

### Final Stage: Deploy in single node kube cluster
