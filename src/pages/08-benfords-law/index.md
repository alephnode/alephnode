_Note: This is the first post in "Code Break", a series focusing solely on math rather than any programming language-specific topics._

I'll never forget sitting in my first required math course for computer science and listening in terror as the instructor went over concepts that were _supposed_ to be working knowledge before starting the class.

Topics like matrices, trigonometric identities, and logarithmic functions flew over my head like a fighter jet. Having emphasized in statistics for my final two years of high school, I felt hopeless.

This prompted a few weeks of extensive Khan Academy use (much love, <a href="https://twitter.com/sophiebits?lang=en" target="_blank">@sophiebits</a>) and Googling until I couldn't see straight.

It was then that I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A" target="_blank">Numpherphile</a>, one of the coolest channels to ever grace Youtube. If you haven't checked it out alreaady, you're playing yourself. The videos take complex topics and reduce them to digestable, engaging snippets.

While the entire catalog is worth binging, one video in particular has resonated with me for years: Benford's Law, or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the ... well-analyzed dataset ðŸ¤”.

You see, for me, math had always been about rote memorization and handling placeholders to predict outcomes. Although I disagree with the notion of "math people" in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/well/family/trying-to-add-up-girls-and-math.html" target="_blank">light of recent evidence</a>, it certainly came natural to me.
