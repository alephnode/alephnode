I was sitting in my first required math course for computer science and listened in terror as the instructor went over concepts that were _supposed_ to be working knowledge before starting the class.

This prompted a week of extensive Khan Academy use (much love, @sophiealpert) and Googling until I couldn't see straight.

It was then that I discovered Numpherphile, one of the coolest channels to ever grace Youtube. If you haven't checked it out alreaady, you're playing yourself.

While the entire catalog is worth binging, one video in particular has resonated with me for years: Benfords Law, or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the ... well-analyzed dataset ðŸ¤”.

You see, for me, math had always been about rote memorization and handling placeholders to predict outcomes. Although I disagree with the notion of "math people" in light of recent evidence, it certainly came natural to me, albeit never _intuitive_ per se.
