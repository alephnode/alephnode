_Note: This is the first post in "Code Break", a series focusing on math rather than any programming language-specific topics._

I'll never forget sitting in my first required math course for computer science and listening in terror as the instructor went over concepts that were _supposed_ to be working knowledge before starting the class.

Topics like matrices, trigonometric identities, and logarithmic functions flew over my head like a fighter jet. Coming from a background in journalism, I felt hopeless.

You see, for me, math had always been about rote memorization and handling placeholders to predict outcomes. Although I disagree with the notion of "math people" in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/well/family/trying-to-add-up-girls-and-math.html" target="_blank">light of recent evidence</a>, topics outside of basic algebra didn't come naturally to me.

This prompted a few weeks of intensive <a href="https://www.mathisfun.com" target="_blank">MathisFun.com</a> and Khan Academy use (much love, <a href="https://twitter.com/sophiebits?lang=en" target="_blank">@sophiebits</a>) and Googling until I couldn't see straight.

It was then that I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A" target="_blank">Numpherphile</a>, one of the most enriching channels to ever grace Youtube. If you haven't checked it out, you're playing yourself. The videos take complex topics and reduce them to digestable, engaging snippets.

While the entire catalog is worth binging, one video topic in particular has resonated with me for years: Benford's Law, or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the ... well-analyzed dataset üßê.

### Some Backstory

When it comes to pop culture's emanating spotlight, most photons land on the normal distribution. This is fair; it uncovers the relationships underlying much of the world around us. Patterns in datasets relating to science, economics, and other areas of study are better identified and predicted as a result of this magical formula.

About 75 years after the bell curve was published by Carl Friedrich Gauss, another theorist made an intriguing observation: the occurrence of natural numbers in large datasets doesn't follow this pattern.

- if newcomb found it, why tf is it named Benford?

### The Law

- describe it -

- example of its use -

### Wrapping up

- rosetta code or whatever (also learn the word masechtomy while you're there)
