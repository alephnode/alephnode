- Need to remember the ~flow~ of old journalism articles. The best ones felt like they provided:

* beg, middle, end (duh)
* nut graf that introduces the central argument of the work (in this case, the theoretical analogies drawn from ML and their limitations)
* possible discussion with an ML scientist?

Machine learning is our best effort to model human intelligence. It codifies our uncanny ability to learn from our environment and manipulate it to achieve a desired result.

The beauty is in the algorithm. The program runs hundreds of trials with parameters meant to model the world. It receives immediate feedback comparing its output with some source of truth. It reworks and refines, tweaking its assumptions. Inching closer to ideality. Clambering to collect even the most marginal improvements.

If we reflect this model back onto ourselves, concerns emerge. Where's the blueprint? Who's providing the feedback?

The immediate response would be morals.
