- best way to define a tensor: it's the representation of all the data we've compiled about the thing we want to predict. It's the weight, make, horsepower, price, and other factors that we use to predict mileage.

Fuck the wikipedia definition

As defined by Google in their workshop: The primary data structure in TensorFlow programs. Tensors are N-dimensional (where N could be very large) data structures, most commonly scalars, vectors, or matrices. The elements of a Tensor can hold integer, floating-point, or string values.

Dig deeper: we're so accustomed to basic correspondence with primitive values. Integer 3 relates to the count of a set of items. Array relates to a list of items in a collection. It's a useful abstraction to describe that.

But what about the more complex entities in life? Ah, objects.

I'm not here to imply that tensors are the natural evolution of data structures in programming languages. Rather, I'm saying that we need quantifiable approximations to find answers about these items.

Google best practice: shuffling/normalizing data
Also Google: batch sizes tend to be between 32-512
