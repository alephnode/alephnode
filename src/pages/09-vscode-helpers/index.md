_VSCode meme of night king impervious to dragon fire_

Hello again, everyone!

After a few busy weeks of work, personal projects, and _Game of Thrones_ fan theory wormholes, I'm dusting the cobwebs off the blog. If I ever take a break that long again, feel free to feed me to the dragons.

Terrible jokes aside, today's article will be a relatively short dive into productivity hacks available in Visual Studio Code (_VSCode hereafter_).

If you're like me, you're constantly looking for ways to improve the development experience. From faster compilation to terminal aliases, anything that cuts precious time is worth considering. What follows are a few of my favorite tricks available in my IDE of choice.

### Wait, Why VSCode? (In Case You Need Convincing)

Although there are several notable IDEs to choose from, VSCode is the only one that combines all the features I enjoy from different solutions into one -- _for free_, at that.

- Excellent support
- Written in JavaScript
- Open Source
- Feature list

### Cool Extensions

With more than <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Downloads" target="_blank">11,000 extensions available</a>, the VSCode marketplace is as robust as it is overwhelming. To help narrow the choices down, here's a list of some that I use daily:

- GitLens: a coworker showed me this and I haven't turned back since
- Code spell checker
- Prettier + ESLint + Format on save
- Live Share (beta AF)
- Slack
- bracket pair colorizer
- version lens

### Custom Snippets

- create your own quickly (show example snippet)
  - options to create own for users, but super helpful to check them in alongside projects for team members

### Terminal Hacks

This section is the most recent set of enhancements I've discovered, but they're by far my favorite on this list.

- naming terminal windows
- quick create
- keyboard shortcut to switch between tabs

### TypeScript Support

- TSLint
- more info: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript

### Testing Assistance

- vscode jest
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome

### Conclusion

If you're curious, I use the _Verdandi Alter_ theme available in the marketplace. While the monochromatic color scheme might seem jarring to some, I appreciate the subtlety it commands with different font treatment to distinguish keywords, strings, and other code areas.

Keep in mind that much of what I mentioned today was about JavaScript productivity assistors. If you have suggestions for other languages, feel free to let me know on Twitter, or start your own blog and share the knowledge!

As always, thanks for reading.
